3. Fixed the problem that a few vehicles were scrapped and expired GPS still displayed on the simulation map, increasing the timeliness of the vehicle
4. Fix the ghost car caused by the Pujiao update, the vehicle outside the simulation map (out of bounds issue), and the JS memory leak caused by the specific situation
